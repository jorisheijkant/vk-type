# vk-type
A bundled version of the typography of de Volkskrant's Kijk Verder department. It consists of various sass files, and a few Vue components.

## How do I import?
You can import all typography by importing "vk-type" from the node_modules folder. You can also import separate modules, but this is not recommended because of internal dependencies.

## Working on vk-type
To test/work on the typography, just clone this repo, install (`yarn install` or `npm install`) and run a dev server (`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`). 

Toggle the label button to see which element is which in the view.
